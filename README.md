This is a practice app based on Treehouse's Node/Express REST API course (thanks [@chalkers](https://www.twitter.com/chalkers)!). I completed the course and am building out the front-end in React. 

To get setup:

1. Clone the repo 
2. Run ```npm install``` 
3. ```npm start``` defaults to the dev server on port 8080 and uses cors headers since the server is on port 3000
4. ```npm start:prod``` serves everything from port 3000

Tests, authentication, and authorization (possibly Redux) are the next pieces to follow.
