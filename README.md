This is a practice app based on Treehouse's Node/Express REST API course (thanks [@chalkers](www.twitter.com/chalkers)!). I completed the course and am building out the front-end in React. 

To get setup:
# Clone the repo 
# Run ```npm install``` 
# ```npm start``` defaults to the dev server on port 8080 and uses cors headers since the server is on port 3000
# ```npm start:prod``` serves everything from port 3000

Tests, authentication, and authorization are the next pieces to follow.
